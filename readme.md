### Install AWS Toolkit

For Eclipse if you're using it.  If not maybe an other AWS plugin.

Just makes editing `*.properies` files a bit easier.

## Usage

If you want to reduce a lot of the Skill boilerplate or provide methods in which users can edit respones - by moving text to properties files they can be externalized to a set of .properties or database tables using a custom ResourceBundle.Control.
